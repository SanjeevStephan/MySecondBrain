## Python allows for user input.

That means we are able to ask the user for input.
The following example asks for the username, and when you entered the username, it gets printed on the screen:

```python
# python 3.6 
username = input("Enter You Name : ")
print("Hey {0}, How are you doing ".format(username))
```
