There are four collection data types in the Python programming language


| Arrays                                                                     | Ordered | Changeable | Allow Duplicates |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| **[List](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp)**              | YES     | YES        | YES              |
| **[Tuple](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp)**            | YES     | NO         | YES              |
| **[Set](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp)**                | NO      | NO         | NO               |
| **[Dictionary](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp)** | YES     | YES        | NO               |

> When choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the properties of that type. Choosing the right type for a particular data set could mean retention of meaning, and, it could mean an increase in efficiency or security.
