> Note 
```
## ChatGPT now has memory across chats

Keep the conversation going

ChatGPT will carry what it learns between chats, allowing it to provide more relevant responses.

More helpful over time

ChatGPT will become more helpful as you chat, continually remembering details and preferences.

Manage what it remembers

You're in control. Review or clear specific memories, restart from scratch, or turn the feature off in settings.
