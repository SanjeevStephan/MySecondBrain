### As hackers, PowerShell can be a formidable ally in our efforts to take control of a system. If we can access a system's PowerShell, we can use its power to control—and maintain control—of the target system. In addition, if we can run our commands and scripts in the PowerShell context, we can evade most antivirus (AV) software and leave little or no evidence behind.

###  that can help us control and manipulate a target system. These specially crafted scripts are known collectively as PowerSploit. Thankfully, they are built into 

### Kali

### . If you are not using Kali, you can download them
