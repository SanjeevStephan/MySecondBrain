> Best Hotkey Ideas for Obsidian  
```python
   You only need Obsidian’s core plugins to use the hotkeys below and increase your workflow’s efficiency. Instead of enabling all of them at once and then forgetting them immediately afterward, try enabling one or two each day and as you get used to them, try more.
   If you forget a hotkey or a feature you enabled, the command palette is always there to help. It will show you everything you can do in Obsidian and any hotkeys you have already set. So keep using it till you remember your hotkeys
```
