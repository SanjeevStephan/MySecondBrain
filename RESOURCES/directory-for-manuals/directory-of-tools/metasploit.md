Metasploit is the work's most popular exploitation framework. It packages nearly everything you need to conduct a pentest into a single software package from scanning, exploitation and post-exploitation.

The Metasploit framework is extensible with modules for payloads, auxiliary, exploits, encoders, post-exploitation and no-operation (NOP) generators. Metasploit is free, but does have commercial versions with additional features and costs.
