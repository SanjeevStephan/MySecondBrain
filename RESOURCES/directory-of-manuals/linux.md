> What is Linux
```javascript
Linux is an open-source computer operating system that has been around since the 90s. Because Linux is open-source, it is not only free to download and install, it is also free to modify and distribute. This means that there isn't just one version of Linux built and maintained by a single company, as with Windows and macOS. There are hundreds of different user-created and distributed variations of Linux, called "distributions" or "distros." Different Linux distributions are built for different needs and purposes.
